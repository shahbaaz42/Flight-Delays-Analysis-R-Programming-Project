# Flight-Delays-Analysis-R-Programming-Project
This project analyzes flight delays using R programming.   The dataset includes flight information such as scheduled time, departure time, carrier, weather, and delay status.   The goal was to visualize the impact of different factors on delays using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar charts, and pie charts.
