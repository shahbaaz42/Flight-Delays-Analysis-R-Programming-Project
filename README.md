# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delays Analysis (R Programming Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes flight delays using **R programming**.  
The dataset includes flight information such as scheduled time, departure time, carrier, weather, and delay status.  
The goal was to visualize the impact of different factors on delays using **histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar charts, and pie charts**.

## üîë Key Insights
- **19.45% of flights were delayed**, 80.55% were on-time.  
- Delays were **more frequent in late evening flights**.  
- Certain airlines had **higher delay rates** than others.  
- **Weather caused only 1.5% of delays**, but when bad weather occurred, delays were almost certain.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Experience
Working on this project gave me a valuable opportunity to apply R programming concepts to a real dataset.  
I learned data cleaning, time conversion, categorical representation, and visualization using **ggplot2** and **dplyr**.  
This project strengthened my ability to explore and present insights clearly.
